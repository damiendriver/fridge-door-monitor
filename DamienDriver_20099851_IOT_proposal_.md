# Fridge Freezer Door Monitor
#### Student Name: Damien Driver   Student ID: 20099851

I would like to build a system to monitor my American style fridge freezer. I regularly notice that family members and friends when visiting open both doors just to have a look inside. Also our 4 year old son likes to open the drawers in the fridge to use as a ladder to the top shelf!!

My idea is to monitor the opening and closing of the doors and report if they have been open for longer than expected. Perhaps taking a picture of the culprit if the door remains open past a certain period. I would also monitor the fridge temperature to check the effect the door opening has. 

## Tools, Technologies and Equipment

Raspberry Pi and Sense Hat attached onto the fridge with sensors to detect for opening / closing

Code to be written in python to track door position and fridge temperature.

MQTT protocol used to publish readings and IOT platform such as Thinkspeak used to read the date and send email / text notifications
